## description

This Python program was written for a geomatics assignment where a property had to be subdivided automatically using a trial-and-error method.
The brief :

Your client has purchased Portion 31 of the farm Wortel Gat No. 723 Caledon. She plans to subdivide it into
three equal portions as follows:

 Create a subdivision line parallel to the southeast boundary of Portion 31 of the farm Wortel Gat No.
723 Caledon (line HJ on SG diagram 5754/95).

 The Portion 2 will join D on SG diagram 5754/95 to the new boundary line created above.

## Input File:
set of coordinate 

## Output:
GUI of all the coordinates plotted 

##future goals with the project

would like to implement multiprocessing to speed up program, this will enable the user to increase precision. Also create a user interface so that the program is not hard coded and can work with any set of coordinates.
